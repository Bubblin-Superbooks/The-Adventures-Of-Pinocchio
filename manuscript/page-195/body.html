    <p>Pinocchio, instead of becoming a boy, runs away to the Land of Toys with his friend, Lamp-Wick.</p>
    <p>Coming at last out of the surprise into which the Fairy's words had thrown him, Pinocchio asked for permission to give out the invitations.</p>
    <p>"Indeed, you may invite your friends to tomorrow's party. Only remember to return home before dark. Do you understand?"</p>
    <p>"I'll be back in one hour without fail," answered the Marionette.</p>
    <p>"Take care, Pinocchio! Boys give promises very easily, but they as easily forget them."</p>
    <p>"But I am not like those others. When I give my word I keep it."</p>
    <p>"We shall see. In case you do disobey, you will be the one to suffer, not anyone else."</p>
