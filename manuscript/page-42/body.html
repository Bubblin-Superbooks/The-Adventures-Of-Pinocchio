    <p>"Boys always sing that song when they want their own will."</p>
    <p>"But I am not like other boys! I am better than all of them and I always tell the truth. I promise you, Father, that I'll learn a trade, and I'll be the comfort and staff of your old age."</p>
    <p>Geppetto, though trying to look very stern, felt his eyes fill with tears and his heart soften when he saw Pinocchio so unhappy. He said no more, but taking his tools and two pieces of wood, he set to work diligently.</p>
    <p>In less than an hour the feet were finished, two slender, nimble little feet, strong and quick, modeled as if by an artist's hands.</p>
    <p>"Close your eyes and sleep!" Geppetto then said to the Marionette.</p>
    <p>Pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep, while Geppetto stuck on the two feet with a bit of glue melted in an eggshell, doing his work so well that the joint could hardly be seen.</p>
