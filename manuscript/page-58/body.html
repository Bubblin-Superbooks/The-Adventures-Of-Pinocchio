    <p>just now. My good dinner is spoiled. I have no more wood for the fire, and the lamb is only half cooked. Never mind! In your place I'll burn some other Marionette. Hey there! Officers!" </p>
    <p>At the call, two wooden officers appeared, long and thin as a yard of rope, with queer hats on their heads and swords in their hands.</p>
    <p>Fire Eater yelled at them in a hoarse voice:</p>
    <p>"Take Harlequin, tie him, and throw him on the fire. I want my lamb well done!"</p>
    <p>Think how poor Harlequin felt! He was so scared that his legs doubled up under him and he fell to the floor.</p>
    <p>Pinocchio, at that heartbreaking sight, threw himself at the feet of Fire Eater and, weeping bitterly, asked in a pitiful voice which could scarcely be heard:</p>
    <p>"Have pity, I beg of you, signore!"</p>
    <p>"There are no signori here!"</p>
    <p>"Have pity, kind sir!"</p>
