            Geppetto had a very bad temper. Woe to the one who called him Polendina! He became as wild as a beast and no one could soothe him.

            "Good day, Mastro Antonio," said Geppetto. "What are you doing on the floor?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "I am teaching the ants their A B C's."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Good luck to you!"
        </p>
        <p>
            "What brought you here, friend Geppetto?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "My legs. And it may flatter you to know, Mastro Antonio, that I have come to you to beg for a favor."
