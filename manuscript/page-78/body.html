    <p>Once more, Pinocchio's head and hands said, "I haven't a penny."</p>
    <p>"Out with that money or you're a dead man," said the taller of the two Assassins.</p>
    <p>"Dead man," repeated the other.</p>
    <p>"And after having killed you, we will kill your father also."</p>
    <p>"Your father also!"</p>
    <p>"No, no, no, not my Father!" cried Pinocchio, wild with terror; but as he screamed, the gold pieces tinkled together in his mouth.</p>
    <p>"Ah, you rascal! So that's the game! You have the money hidden under your tongue. Out with it!"</p>

    <p>"Are you deaf? Wait, young man, we'll get it from you in a twinkling!"</p>
