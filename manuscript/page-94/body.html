    <p>"Drink it and I'll give you a lump of sugar to take the bitter taste from your mouth."</p>
    <p>"Where's the sugar?"</p>
    <p>"Here it is," said the Fairy, taking a lump from a golden sugar bowl.</p>
    <p>"I want the sugar first, then I'll drink the bitter water."</p>
    <p>"Do you promise?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>The Fairy gave him the sugar and Pinocchio, after chewing and swallowing it in a twinkling, said, smacking his lips:</p>
    <p>"If only sugar were medicine! I should take it every day."</p>
    <p>"Now keep your promise and drink these few drops of water. They'll be good for you."</p>
    <p>Pinocchio took the glass in both hands and stuck his nose into it. He lifted it to his mouth and once more stuck his nose into it.</p>
