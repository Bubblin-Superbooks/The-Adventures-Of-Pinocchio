    <p>At that second knock, a window on the third floor opened and the same Snail looked out.</p>
    <p>"Dear little Snail," cried Pinocchio from the street. "I have been waiting two hours for you! And two hours on a dreadful night like this are as long as two years. Hurry, please!"</p>
    <p>"My boy," answered the Snail in a calm, peaceful voice, "my dear boy, I am a snail and snails are never in a hurry." And the window closed.</p>
    <p>A few minutes later midnight struck; then one o'clockâ€”two o'clock. And the door still remained closed!</p>
    <p>Then Pinocchio, losing all patience, grabbed the knocker with both hands, fully determined to awaken the whole house and street with it. As soon as he touched the knocker, however, it became an eel and wiggled away into the darkness.</p>
    <p>"Really?" cried Pinocchio, blind with rage. "If the knocker is gone, I can still use my feet."</p>
