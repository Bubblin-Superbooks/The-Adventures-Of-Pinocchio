    <p>"I'm very thirsty!"</p>
    <p>"And I'm very hungry!" said Pinocchio.</p>
    <p>"Let us stop a few minutes at that pigeon coop down there. Then we can go on and be at the seashore in the morning."</p>
    <p>They went into the empty coop and there they found nothing but a bowl of water and a small basket filled with chick-peas.</p>
    <p>The Marionette had always hated chick-peas. According to him, they had always made him sick; but that night he ate them with a relish. As he finished them, he turned to the Pigeon and said:</p>
    <p>"I never should have thought that chick-peas could be so good!"</p>
    <p>"You must remember, my boy," answered the Pigeon, "that hunger is the best sauce!"</p>
    <p>After resting a few minutes longer, they set out again. The next morning they were at the seashore.</p>
