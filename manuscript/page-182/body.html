    <p>Pinocchio returns to the Fairy's house and she promises him that, on the morrow, he will cease to be a Marionette and become a boy. A wonderful party of coffee-and-milk to celebrate the great event.</p>
    <p>Mindful of what the Fisherman had said, Pinocchio knew that all hope of being saved had gone. He closed his eyes and waited for the final moment.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, a large Dog, attracted by the odor of the boiling oil, came running into the cave.</p>
    <p>"Get out!" cried the Fisherman threateningly and still holding onto the Marionette, who was all covered with flour.</p>
    <p>But the poor Dog was very hungry, and whining and wagging his tail, he tried to say:</p>
    <p>"Give me a bite of the fish and I'll go in peace."</p>
    <p>"Get out, I say!" repeated the Fisherman.</p>
