    <p>"Look, look! Am I asleep or awake? Or do I really see Pinocchio there?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, yes! It is Pinocchio!" screamed Pulcinella.</p>
    <p>"It is! It is!" shrieked Signora Rosaura, peeking in from the side of the stage.</p>
    <p>"It is Pinocchio! It is Pinocchio!" yelled all the Marionettes, pouring out of the wings. "It is Pinocchio. It is our brother Pinocchio! Hurrah for Pinocchio!"</p>
    <p>"Pinocchio, come up to me!" shouted Harlequin. "Come to the arms of your wooden brothers!"</p>
    <p>At such a loving invitation, Pinocchio, with one leap from the back of the orchestra, found himself in the front rows. With another leap, he was on the orchestra leader's head. With a third, he landed on the stage.</p>
    <p>It is impossible to describe the shrieks of joy, the warm embraces, the knocks, and the friendly greetings with which that strange company of dramatic actors and actresses received Pinocchio.</p>
