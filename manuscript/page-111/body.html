He went up to the place where he had dug the hole and buried the gold pieces. Again nothing! Pinocchio became very thoughtful and, forgetting his good manners altogether, he pulled a hand out of his pocket and gave his head a thorough scratching. </p>
    <p>As he did so, he heard a hearty burst of laughter close to his head. He turned sharply, and there, just above him on the branch of a tree, sat a large Parrot, busily preening his feathers.</p>
    <p>"What are you laughing at?" Pinocchio asked peevishly.</p>
    <p>"I am laughing because, in preening my feathers, I tickled myself under the wings."</p>
    <p>The Marionette did not answer. He walked to the brook, filled his shoe with water, and once more sprinkled the ground which covered the gold pieces.</p>
    <p>Another burst of laughter, even more impertinent than the first, was heard in the quiet field.</p>
