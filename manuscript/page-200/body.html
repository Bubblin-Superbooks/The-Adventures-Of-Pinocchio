    <p>"It's too late!"</p>
    <p>"Only two minutes."</p>
    <p>"And if the Fairy scolds me?"</p>
    <p>"Let her scold. After she gets tired, she will stop," said Lamp-Wick.</p>
    <p>"Are you going alone or with others?"</p>
    <p>"Alone? There will be more than a hundred of us!"</p>
    <p>"Will you walk?"</p>
