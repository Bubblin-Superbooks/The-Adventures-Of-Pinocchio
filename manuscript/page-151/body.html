    <p>Pinocchio promises the Fairy to be good and to study, as he is growing tired of being a Marionette, and wishes to become a real boy.</p>
    <p>If Pinocchio cried much longer, the little woman thought he would melt away, so she finally admitted that she was the little Fairy with Azure Hair.</p>
    <p>"You rascal of a Marionette! How did you know it was I?" she asked, laughing.</p>
    <p>"My love for you told me who you were."</p>
    <p>"Do you remember? You left me when I was a little girl and now you find me a grown woman. I am so old, I could almost be your mother!"</p>
    <p>"I am very glad of that, for then I can call you mother instead of sister. For a long time I have wanted a mother, just like other boys. But how did you grow so quickly?"</p>
    <p>"That's a secret!"</p>
