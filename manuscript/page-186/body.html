    <p>"And what do you think of him?" asked the old man.</p>
    <p>"I think he's a very good boy, fond of study, obedient, kind to his Father, and to his whole family—"</p>
    <p>As he was telling all these enormous lies about himself, Pinocchio touched his nose and found it twice as long as it should be. Scared out of his wits, he cried out:</p>
    <p>"Don't listen to me, good man! All the wonderful things I have said are not true at all. I know Pinocchio well and he is indeed a very wicked fellow, lazy and disobedient, who instead of going to school, runs away with his playmates to have a good time."</p>
    <p>At this speech, his nose returned to its natural size.</p>
    <p>"Why are you so pale?" the old man asked suddenly.</p>
