    <p>streets, why don't you look for work and earn your own bread?" </p>
    <p>Finally a little woman went by carrying two water jugs.</p>
    <p>"Good woman, will you allow me to have a drink from one of your jugs?" asked Pinocchio, who was burning up with thirst.</p>
    <p>"With pleasure, my boy!" she answered, setting the two jugs on the ground before him.</p>
    <p>When Pinocchio had had his fill, he grumbled, as he wiped his mouth:</p>
    <p>"My thirst is gone. If I could only as easily get rid of my hunger!"</p>
    <p>On hearing these words, the good little woman immediately said:</p>
    <p>"If you help me to carry these jugs home, I'll give you a slice of bread."</p>
    <p>Pinocchio looked at the jug and said neither yes nor no.</p>
