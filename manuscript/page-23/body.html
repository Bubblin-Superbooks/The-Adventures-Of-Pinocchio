    <p>The story of Pinocchio and the Talking Cricket, in which one sees that bad children do not like to be corrected by those who know more than they do.</p>
    <p>Very little time did it take to get poor old Geppetto to prison. In the meantime that rascal, Pinocchio, free now from the clutches of the Carabineer, was running wildly across fields and meadows, taking one short cut after another toward home. In his wild flight, he leaped over brambles and bushes, and across brooks and ponds, as if he were a goat or a hare chased by hounds.</p>
    <p>On reaching home, he found the house door half open. He slipped into the room, locked the door, and threw himself on the floor, happy at his escape.</p>
    <p>But his happiness lasted only a short time, for just then he heard someone saying:</p>
    <p>"Cri-cri-cri!"</p>
    <p>"Who is calling me?" asked Pinocchio, greatly frightened.</p>
