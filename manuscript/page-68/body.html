    <p>"But how can they possibly become so many?" asked Pinocchio wonderingly.</p>
    <p>"I'll explain," said the Fox. "You must know that, just outside the City of Simple Simons, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders. In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece. After covering up the hole with earth you water it well, sprinkle a bit of salt on it, and go to bed. During the night, the gold piece sprouts, grows, blossoms, and next morning you find a beautiful tree, that is loaded with gold pieces."</p>
    <p>"So that if I were to bury my five gold pieces," cried Pinocchio with growing wonder, "next morning I should findâ€”how many?"</p>
    <p>"It is very simple to figure out," answered the Fox. "Why, you can figure it on your fingers! Granted that each piece gives you five hundred, multiply five hundred by five. Next morning you will find twenty-five hundred new, sparkling gold pieces."</p>
    <p>"Fine! Fine!" cried Pinocchio, dancing about with joy. </p>
