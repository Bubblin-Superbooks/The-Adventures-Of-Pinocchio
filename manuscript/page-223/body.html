    <p>An embarrassingly long silence followed these words, during which time the two friends looked at each other in a mocking way.</p>
    <p>Finally the Marionette, in a voice sweet as honey and soft as a flute, said to his companion:</p>
    <p>"Tell me, Lamp-Wick, dear friend, have you ever suffered from an earache?"</p>
    <p>"Never! And you?"</p>
    <p>"Never! Still, since this morning my ear has been torturing me."</p>
    <p>"So has mine."</p>
    <p>"Yours, too? And which ear is it?"</p>
    <p>"Both of them. And yours?"</p>
    <p>"Both of them, too. I wonder if it could be the same sickness."</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid it is."</p>
    <p>"Will you do me a favor, Lamp-Wick?"</p>
