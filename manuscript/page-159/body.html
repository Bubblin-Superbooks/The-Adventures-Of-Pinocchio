    <p>The teacher warned him each day, and even the good Fairy repeated to him many times:</p>
    <p>"Take care, Pinocchio! Those bad companions will sooner or later make you lose your love for study. Some day they will lead you astray."</p>

    <p>So it happened that one day, as he was walking to school, he met some boys who ran up to him and said:</p>
    <p>"Have you heard the news?"</p>
    <p>"No!"</p>
    <p>"A Shark as big as a mountain has been seen near the shore."</p>
    <p>"Really? I wonder if it could be the same one I heard of when my father was drowned?"</p>
