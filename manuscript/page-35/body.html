    <h3> Geppetto returns home and gives his own breakfast to the Marionette </h3>
    <p>The poor Marionette, who was still half asleep, had not yet found out that his two feet were burned and gone. As soon as he heard his Father's voice, he jumped up from his seat to open the door, but, as he did so, he staggered and fell headlong to the floor.</p>
    <p>In falling, he made as much noise as a sack of wood falling from the fifth story of a house.</p>
    <p>"Open the door for me!" Geppetto shouted from the street.</p>
    <p>"Father, dear Father, I can't," answered the Marionette in despair, crying and rolling on the floor.</p>
    <p>"Why can't you?"</p>
    <p>"Because someone has eaten my feet."</p>
    <p>"And who has eaten them?"</p>
