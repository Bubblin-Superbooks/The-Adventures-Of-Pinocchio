    <p>Pinocchio jumped off the Pigeon's back, and the Pigeon, not wanting any thanks for a kind deed, flew away swiftly and disappeared.</p>
    <p>The shore was full of people, shrieking and tearing their hair as they looked toward the sea.</p>
    <p>"What has happened?" asked Pinocchio of a little old woman.</p>
    <p>"A poor old father lost his only son some time ago and today he built a tiny boat for himself in order to go in search of him across the ocean. The water is very rough and we're afraid he will be drowned."</p>
    <p>"Where is the little boat?"</p>
    <p>"There. Straight down there," answered the little old woman, pointing to a tiny shadow, no bigger than a nutshell, floating on the sea.</p>
    <p>Pinocchio looked closely for a few minutes and then gave a sharp cry:</p>
    <p>"It's my father! It's my father!"</p>
