    <p>Geppetto makes Pinocchio a new pair of feet, and sells his coat to buy him an A-B-C book.</p>
    <p>The Marionette, as soon as his hunger was appeased, started to grumble and cry that he wanted a new pair of feet.</p>
    <p>But Mastro Geppetto, in order to punish him for his mischief, let him alone the whole morning. After dinner he said to him:</p>
    <p>"Why should I make your feet over again? To see you run away from home once more?"</p>
    <p>"I promise you," answered the Marionette, sobbing, "that from now on I'll be good—"</p>
    <p>"Boys always promise that when they want something," said Geppetto.</p>
    <p>"I promise to go to school every day, to study, and to succeed—"</p>
