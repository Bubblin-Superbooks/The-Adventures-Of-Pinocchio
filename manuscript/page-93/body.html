    <p>Pinocchio eats sugar, but refuses to take medicine. When the undertakers come for him, he drinks the medicine and feels better. Afterwards he tells a lie and, in punishment, his nose grows longer and longer.</p>
    <p>As soon as the three doctors had left the room, the Fairy went to Pinocchio's bed and, touching him on the forehead, noticed that he was burning with fever.</p>
    <p>She took a glass of water, put a white powder into it, and, handing it to the Marionette, said lovingly to him:</p>
    <p>"Drink this, and in a few days you'll be up and well."</p>
    <p>Pinocchio looked at the glass, made a wry face, and asked in a whining voice: "Is it sweet or bitter?"</p>
    <p>"It is bitter, but it is good for you."</p>
    <p>"If it is bitter, I don't want it."</p>
    <p>"Drink it!"</p>
    <p>"I don't like anything bitter."</p>
