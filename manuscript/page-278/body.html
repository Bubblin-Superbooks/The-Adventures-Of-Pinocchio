    <pre>       The Fairy with Azure Hair returns
       fifty pennies to her dear Pinocchio
       with many thanks for his kind heart.
  </pre>
    <p>The Marionette opened the purse to find the money, and beholdâ€”there were fifty gold coins!</p>
    <p>Pinocchio ran to the mirror. He hardly recognized himself. The bright face of a tall boy looked at him with wide-awake blue eyes, dark brown hair and happy, smiling lips.</p>
    <p>Surrounded by so much splendor, the Marionette hardly knew what he was doing. He rubbed his eyes two or three times, wondering if he were still asleep or awake and decided he must be awake.</p>
    <p>"And where is Father?" he cried suddenly. He ran into the next room, and there stood Geppetto, grown years younger overnight, spick and span in his new clothes and gay as a lark in the morning. He was once more Mastro Geppetto, the wood carver, hard at work on a lovely picture frame, decorating it with flowers and leaves, and heads of animals.</p>
