    <p>childrenâ€”and they were all lucky. The richest of them begged for his living." </p>
    <p>After choosing the name for his Marionette, Geppetto set seriously to work to make the hair, the forehead, the eyes. Fancy his surprise when he noticed that these eyes moved and then stared fixedly at him. Geppetto, seeing this, felt insulted and said in a grieved tone:</p>
    <p>"Ugly wooden eyes, why do you stare so?"</p>
    <p>There was no answer.</p>
    <p>After the eyes, Geppetto made the nose, which began to stretch as soon as finished. It stretched and stretched and stretched till it became so long, it seemed endless.</p>
    <p>Poor Geppetto kept cutting it and cutting it, but the more he cut, the longer grew that impertinent nose. In despair he let it alone.</p>
    <p>Next he made the mouth.</p>
    <p>No sooner was it finished than it began to laugh and poke fun at him.</p>
