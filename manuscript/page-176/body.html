    <p>His mind made up, Pinocchio swam to the rocks, but as he started to climb, he felt something under him lifting him up higher and higher. He tried to escape, but he was too late. To his great surprise, he found himself in a huge net, amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes, who were fighting and struggling desperately to free themselves.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he saw a Fisherman come out of the cave, a Fisherman so ugly that Pinocchio thought he was a sea monster. In place of hair, his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass. Green was the skin of his body, green were his eyes, green was the long, long beard that reached down to his feet. He looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms.</p>
    <p>When the Fisherman pulled the net out of the sea, he cried out joyfully:</p>
    <p>"Blessed Providence! Once more I'll have a fine meal of fish!"</p>
    <p>"Thank Heaven, I'm not a fish!" said Pinocchio to himself, trying with these words to find a little courage.</p>
