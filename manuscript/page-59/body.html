    <p>"There are no sirs here!"</p>
    <p>"Have pity, your Excellency!"</p>
    <p>On hearing himself addressed as your Excellency, the Director of the Marionette Theater sat up very straight in his chair, stroked his long beard, and becoming suddenly kind and compassionate, smiled proudly as he said to Pinocchio:</p>
    <p>"Well, what do you want from me now, Marionette?"</p>
    <p>"I beg for mercy for my poor friend, Harlequin, who has never done the least harm in his life."</p>
    <p>"There is no mercy here, Pinocchio. I have spared you. Harlequin must burn in your place. I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked."</p>
    <p>"In that case," said Pinocchio proudly, as he stood up and flung away his cap of dough, "in that case, my duty is clear. Come, officers! Tie me up and throw me on those flames. No, it is not fair for poor Harlequin, the best friend that I have in the world, to die in my place!"</p>
