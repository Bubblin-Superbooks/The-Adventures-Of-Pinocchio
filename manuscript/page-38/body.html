    <p>"You may be right," answered Pinocchio, "but I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled. I don't like them."</p>
    <p>And good old Geppetto took out a knife, peeled the three pears, and put the skins in a row on the table.</p>
    <p>Pinocchio ate one pear in a twinkling and started to throw the core away, but Geppetto held his arm.</p>
    <p>"Oh, no, don't throw it away! Everything in this world may be of some use!"</p>
