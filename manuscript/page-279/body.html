    <p>"Father, Father, what has happened? Tell me if you can," cried Pinocchio, as he ran and jumped on his Father's neck.</p>
    <p>"This sudden change in our house is all your doing, my dear Pinocchio," answered Geppetto.</p>
    <p>"What have I to do with it?"</p>
    <p>"Just this. When bad boys become good and kind, they have the power of making their homes gay and new with happiness."</p>
    <p>"I wonder where the old Pinocchio of wood has hidden himself?"</p>
    <p>"There he is," answered Geppetto. And he pointed to a large Marionette leaning against a chair, head turned to one side, arms hanging limp, and legs twisted under him.</p>
    <p>After a long, long look, Pinocchio said to himself with great content:</p>
    <p>"How ridiculous I was as a Marionette! And how happy I am, now that I have become a real boy!"</p>
