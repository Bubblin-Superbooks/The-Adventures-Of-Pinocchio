    <p>look about him. </p>
    <p>Lamp-Wick was the laziest boy in the school and the biggest mischief-maker, but Pinocchio loved him dearly.</p>
    <p>That day, he went straight to his friend's house to invite him to the party, but Lamp-Wick was not at home. He went a second time, and again a third, but still without success.</p>
    <p>Where could he be? Pinocchio searched here and there and everywhere, and finally discovered him hiding near a farmer's wagon.</p>
    <p>"What are you doing there?" asked Pinocchio, running up to him.</p>
    <p>"I am waiting for midnight to strike to goâ€”"</p>
    <p>"Where?"</p>
    <p>"Far, far away!"</p>
    <p>"And I have gone to your house three times to look for you!"</p>
