    <p>Pinocchio goes to the seashore with his friends to see the Terrible Shark.</p>
    <p>In the morning, bright and early, Pinocchio started for school.</p>
    <p>Imagine what the boys said when they saw a Marionette enter the classroom! They laughed until they cried. Everyone played tricks on him. One pulled his hat off, another tugged at his coat, a third tried to paint a mustache under his nose. One even attempted to tie strings to his feet and his hands to make him dance.</p>
    <p>For a while Pinocchio was very calm and quiet. Finally, however, he lost all patience and turning to his tormentors, he said to them threateningly:</p>
    <p>"Careful, boys, I haven't come here to be made fun of. I'll respect you and I want you to respect me."</p>
    <p>"Hurrah for Dr. Know-all! You have spoken like a printed book!" howled the boys, bursting with laughter. </p>
