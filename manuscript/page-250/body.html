    <p>"What nonsense!" cried Pinocchio.</p>
    <p>"Mine is an opinion," replied the Tunny, "and opinions should be respected."</p>
    <p>"But I want to get out of this place. I want to escape."</p>
    <p>"Go, if you can!"</p>
    <p>"Is this Shark that has swallowed us very long?" asked the Marionette.</p>
