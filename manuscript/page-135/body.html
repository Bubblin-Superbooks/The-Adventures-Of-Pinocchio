    <p>Marionette, jumping to his feet. "Why, I am Pinocchio!" </p>
    <p>At this answer, the Pigeon flew swiftly down to the earth. He was much larger than a turkey.</p>
    <p>"Then you know Geppetto also?"</p>
    <p>"Do I know him? He's my father, my poor, dear father! Has he, perhaps, spoken to you of me? Will you take me to him? Is he still alive? Answer me, please! Is he still alive?"</p>
    <p>"I left him three days ago on the shore of a large sea."</p>
    <p>"What was he doing?"</p>
    <p>"He was building a little boat with which to cross the ocean. For the last four months, that poor man has been wandering around Europe, looking for you. Not having found you yet, he has made up his mind to look for you in the New World, far across the ocean."</p>
    <p>"How far is it from here to the shore?" asked Pinocchio anxiously.</p>
    <p>"More than fifty miles."</p>
