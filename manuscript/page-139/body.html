    <p>Meanwhile, the little boat, tossed about by the angry waters, appeared and disappeared in the waves. And Pinocchio, standing on a high rock, tired out with searching, waved to him with hand and cap and even with his nose.</p>
    <p>It looked as if Geppetto, though far away from the shore, recognized his son, for he took off his cap and waved also. He seemed to be trying to make everyone understand that he would come back if he were able, but the sea was so heavy that he could do nothing with his oars. Suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared.</p>
    <p>They waited and waited for it, but it was gone.</p>
    <p>"Poor man!" said the fisher folk on the shore, whispering a prayer as they turned to go home.</p>
    <p>Just then a desperate cry was heard. Turning around, the fisher folk saw Pinocchio dive into the sea and heard him cry out:</p>
    <p>"I'll save him! I'll save my father!"</p>
