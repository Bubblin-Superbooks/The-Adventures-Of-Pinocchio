    <p>Pinocchio is thrown into the sea, eaten by fishes, and becomes a Marionette once more. As he swims to land, he is swallowed by the Terrible Shark.</p>
    <p>Down into the sea, deeper and deeper, sank Pinocchio, and finally, after fifty minutes of waiting, the man on the cliff said to himself:</p>
    <p>"By this time my poor little lame Donkey must be drowned. Up with him and then I can get to work on my beautiful drum."</p>
