    <p>At this answer, Pinocchio's happiness was very great. He grasped the Fairy's hands and kissed them so hard that it looked as if he had lost his head. Then lifting his face, he looked at her lovingly and asked: "Tell me, little Mother, it isn't true that you are dead, is it?"</p>
    <p>"It doesn't seem so," answered the Fairy, smiling.</p>
    <p>"If you only knew how I suffered and how I wept when I read 'Here liesâ€”'"</p>
    <p>"I know it, and for that I have forgiven you. The depth of your sorrow made me see that you have a kind heart. There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours, though they may often be very mischievous. This is the reason why I have come so far to look for you. From now on, I'll be your own little mother."</p>
    <p>"Oh! How lovely!" cried Pinocchio, jumping with joy.</p>
    <p>"You will obey me always and do as I wish?"</p>
    <p>"Gladly, very gladly, more than gladly!"</p>
