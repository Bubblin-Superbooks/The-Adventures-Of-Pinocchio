    <p>"Too bad! That offense would have been more than pleasing to me," said Pinocchio, scratching his head.</p>
    <p>"Where did my good friends say they would wait for me?" he added.</p>
    <p>"At the Field of Wonders, at sunrise tomorrow morning."</p>
    <p>Pinocchio paid a gold piece for the three suppers and started on his way toward the field that was to make him a rich man.</p>
    <p>He walked on, not knowing where he was going, for it was dark, so dark that not a thing was visible. Round about him, not a leaf stirred. A few bats skimmed his nose now and again and scared him half to death. Once or twice he shouted, "Who goes there?" and the far-away hills echoed back to him, "Who goes there? Who goes there? Who goes. . . ?"</p>
    <p>As he walked, Pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree, a small being that glowed with a pale, soft light.</p>
