    <p>What happened to Lamp-Wick? My dear children, I do not know. Pinocchio, I can tell you, met with great hardships even from the first day.</p>
    <p>After putting him in a stable, his new master filled his manger with straw, but Pinocchio, after tasting a mouthful, spat it out.</p>
    <p>Then the man filled the manger with hay. But Pinocchio did not like that any better.</p>
    <p>"Ah, you don't like hay either?" he cried angrily. "Wait, my pretty Donkey, I'll teach you not to be so particular."</p>
    <p>Without more ado, he took a whip and gave the Donkey a hearty blow across the legs.</p>
    <p>Pinocchio screamed with pain and as he screamed he brayed:</p>
    <p>"Haw! Haw! Haw! I can't digest straw!"</p>
    <p>"Then eat the hay!" answered his master, who understood the Donkey perfectly.</p>
    <p>"Haw! Haw! Haw! Hay gives me a headache!"</p>
