    <p>At this question, the Donkey opened weary, dying eyes and answered in the same tongue: "I am Lamp-Wick."</p>
    <p>Then he closed his eyes and died.</p>
    <p>"Oh, my poor Lamp-Wick," said Pinocchio in a faint voice, as he wiped his eyes with some straw he had picked up from the ground.</p>
    <p>"Do you feel so sorry for a little donkey that has cost you nothing?" said the Farmer. "What should I doâ€”I, who have paid my good money for him?"</p>
    <p>"But, you see, he was my friend."</p>
    <p>"Your friend?"</p>
    <p>"A classmate of mine."</p>
    <p>"What," shouted Farmer John, bursting out laughing. "What! You had donkeys in your school? How you must have studied!"</p>
    <p>The Marionette, ashamed and hurt by those words, did not answer, but taking his glass of milk returned to his father.</p>
