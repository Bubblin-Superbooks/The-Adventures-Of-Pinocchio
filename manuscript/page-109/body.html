    <p>back a pail full of water, and sprinkle it over the spot." </p>
    <p>Pinocchio followed the directions closely, but, as he had no pail, he pulled off his shoe, filled it with water, and sprinkled the earth which covered the gold. Then he asked:</p>
    <p>"Anything else?"</p>
    <p>"Nothing else," answered the Fox. "Now we can go. Return here within twenty minutes and you will find the vine grown and the branches filled with gold pieces."</p>
    <p>Pinocchio, beside himself with joy, thanked the Fox and the Cat many times and promised them each a beautiful gift.</p>
    <p>"We don't want any of your gifts," answered the two rogues. "It is enough for us that we have helped you to become rich with little or no trouble. For this we are as happy as kings."</p>
    <p>They said good-by to Pinocchio and, wishing him good luck, went on their way.</p>
